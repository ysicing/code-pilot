> Transform your development workflow from manual command chains to automated expert teams with **lightweight quality gates** and **professional specialization**.

## 🎯 Core Philosophy

**Quality Gate Automation + Professional Specialization + Lightweight Process**

This repository provides a **lightweight meta-framework for Claude Code** that implements:

- **🎛️ Quality Gate Automation**: Objective 90% standards replace subjective judgment
- **🧠 Professional Specialization**: Each tool focuses on one domain (avoid "万能AI")  
- **⚡ Lightweight Process**: Essential workflow steps without bureaucracy
- **📊 Context Isolation**: Each agent maintains focused expertise without pollution
- **🎯 Smart Testing**: Proportional testing with UI-aware strategies to prevent over-testing

## 🚀 From Manual Chaos to Automated Quality

**Before**: Manual command chains requiring constant oversight
```bash
/ask → /code → /test → /bugfix → /optimize
# 1-2 hours of manual orchestration, subjective quality judgment
```

**After**: One-command automated expert workflows with objective quality gates
```bash
/requirements-pilot "Implement JWT user authentication system"
# 30 minutes of automated execution, 90% quality gates, smart testing decisions
```

## 📋 Two Primary Usage Patterns

### 1. 🏭 Requirements-Driven Workflow (Automated Expert Teams)

**Architecture**: Requirements-focused workflow with quality gates and smart testing
```
requirements-generate → requirements-code → requirements-review → (✅ Ready?) → smart-testing-decision
         ↑                                              ↓ (⚠️ Needs Improvement)
         ←←←←←← Automatic optimization loop ←←←←←←
```

**Usage**:
```bash
# Complete development workflow in one command
/requirements-pilot "Build user management system with RBAC"

# Advanced workflow with intelligent testing
First use requirements-generate, then requirements-code, then requirements-review, 
then if Ready ask user: "Code complete. Run tests? (y/n/lint)"
```

### 2. 🎛️ Stage-Based Development (Manual Orchestration)

**Architecture**: Stage-specific tools for targeted expertise

#### **📋 Stage 1: Requirements Analysis**
```bash
/story-breakdown     # Transform complex features into implementable user stories
                     # - 1-3 day completion estimates
                     # - Clear acceptance criteria  
                     # - Implementation priority order
                     # - Dependency mapping
```

#### **🏛️ Stage 2: Architecture Design**  
```bash
/ask                # Senior Systems Architect consultation
                    # - Multi-expert consultation (4 specialists)
                    # - UltraThink methodology for comprehensive analysis
                    # - Strategic technology guidance with trade-off analysis
                    # - Pure architectural guidance, no code changes
```

#### **⚡ Stage 3: Implementation**
```bash
/requirements-pilot # Complete automated pipeline (recommended)
                    # - 100-point quality assessment with user approval gate
                    # - Smart testing decisions (--test/--no-test)
                    # - File structure management (.claude/specs/)

/code               # Direct feature implementation
                    # - For simple features or specific components
```

#### **🔍 Stage 4: Quality Assurance**
```bash
/review             # Multi-dimensional code review
                    # - 4 specialist reviewers (Quality, Security, Performance, Architecture)
                    # - 3-level scoring: ✅ Ready / ⚠️ Needs Improvement / ❌ Major Issues
                    # - Pragmatic focus on functionality over perfection
```

#### **🧪 Stage 5: Testing**
```bash
/test               # Smart testing strategies
                    # - UI changes: Lint-only approach
                    # - Minor changes (1-5 lines): Proportional testing
                    # - Business logic: Comprehensive testing
```

#### **🐛 Stage 6: Problem Resolution**
```bash
/debug              # UltraThink Debug Orchestrator
                    # - 4-phase systematic debugging
                    # - Hypothesis refinement (5-7 → 1-2 solutions)
                    # - User confirmation gate before fixes
                    # - Evidence-based diagnostic strategy
```

#### **🚀 Stage 7: Release Preparation**
```bash
/release-check      # Production readiness verification
                    # - Risk-based go/no-go decisions
                    # - Practical checklist approach
                    # - Clear mitigation plans for issues
```

## 🔧 **Flexible Usage Patterns**

### Pattern 1: Complete Automation (New Features)
```bash
# Single command handles entire workflow
/requirements-pilot "JWT authentication with refresh tokens" --test
# → Requirements(90+) → User approval → Code → Review(90+) → Testing
```

### Pattern 2: Step-by-Step Control (Complex Features)  
```bash
/story-breakdown "E-commerce checkout flow"  # Break into stories
/ask "Microservices vs monolith for checkout"  # Architecture guidance
/requirements-pilot "Payment processing story 1"  # Implement story by story
/review "Validate payment security"  # Quality gates
/release-check "Payment system"  # Production readiness
```

### Pattern 3: Problem-Driven (Bug Fixes)
```bash
/debug "Production API timeout issues"  # Systematic diagnosis
/code "Implement connection pooling fix"  # Direct fix implementation  
/release-check "Updated API service"  # Verify production readiness
```

### Pattern 4: Quality-First (Critical Systems)
```bash
/story-breakdown "Financial transaction system"
/ask "Security architecture for financial data"
/requirements-pilot "Core transaction logic" --test
/review "Security and performance validation"  
/release-check "Financial system components"
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Single Command Development
```bash
# One command handles everything - requirements, implementation, review, testing
/requirements-pilot "Create REST API for user authentication with JWT tokens"

# Advanced usage with testing control
/requirements-pilot "Build e-commerce cart system" --test
/requirements-pilot "Add UI theme switcher" --no-test  # UI-only changes
```

### Stage-Based Development  
```bash
# Requirements analysis first
/story-breakdown "User management system with RBAC permissions"

# Architecture consultation
/ask "Best practices for role-based access control in microservices"

# Implementation with quality gates
/requirements-pilot "User registration story" --test

# Production readiness
/release-check "User management components"
```

### Setup Configuration

Clone or copy the configuration structure:
```bash
# Your project directory
├── commands/          # 10 specialized slash commands
├── agents/           # 9 expert agent configurations  
├── CLAUDE.md         # System instructions for Claude Code
└── WORKFLOW-GUIDE.md # Stage-based usage guide
```

## 💡 **Key Innovations**

### 1. **Quality Gate Automation**
Replace subjective judgment with objective 90% scoring:
```python
# Traditional: "I think the code is ready"
if developer_subjective_opinion:
    proceed()

# This System: Objective quality measurement
if requirements_score >= 90 and code_quality >= 90:
    proceed()
else:
    optimize_and_retry()
```

### 2. **Professional Specialization**
Avoid "万能AI" by using domain experts:
```bash
❌ One AI does everything: requirements + coding + testing + deployment
✅ Expert team: Requirements expert + Code expert + Quality expert + Testing expert
```

### 3. **Smart Testing Prevention of Over-Testing**
Proportional testing based on change impact:
```bash
# UI color change (1 line) → Lint check only
# Business logic change (50 lines) → Full test suite
# New feature → Comprehensive testing with edge cases
```

## 📚 Workflow Examples

### Enterprise User Authentication System

**Step-by-Step Approach**:
```bash
# Requirements analysis
/story-breakdown "Enterprise SSO with LDAP integration"

# Architecture consultation  
/ask "LDAP integration patterns for high-availability systems"
